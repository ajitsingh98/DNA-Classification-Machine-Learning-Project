# DNA-Classification-Project
<p>In this project, we will explore the world of bioinformatics by using Markov models, K-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithms, support vector machines, and other common classifiers to classify short E. Coli DNA sequences. This project will use a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository that has 106 DNA sequences, with 57 sequential nucleotides (“base-pairs”) each.</p>

<p>It includes :</p>
<ul>
<li>Importing data from the UCI repository</li>
<li>Converting text inputs to numerical data</li>
<li>Building and training classification algorithms</li>
<li>Comparing and contrasting classification algorithms</li>
</ul>
